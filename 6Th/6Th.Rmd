##Section 1: In silico docking of drugs to HIV-1 protease
We want to produce a protein-only PDB file and drug-only PDB file. 
```{r}
library(bio3d)
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
hiv <- read.pdb(file.name)
hiv
```
Q1: What is the name of the two non protein resid values in this structure? What does resid
correspond to and how would you get a listing of all reside values in this structure? 
HOH and MK1
```{r}

```

```{r}
protein <- atom.select(hiv, "protein",value=T)
protein
```



```{r}
prot <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
protein <- atom.select(hiv, "protein",value=T)
lig <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
ligand <- atom.select(hiv, "ligand",value=T)
write.pdb(prot, file="1hsg_protein.pdb")
write.pdb(lig, file="1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```
